    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A green bean casserole makes the Thanksgiving holiday complete, and this version 
        can be on the table in no time at all thanks to just four ingredients from your pantry 
        or fridge: canned green beans, condensed mushroom soup, French-fried onions, and shredded 
        Cheddar cheese.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cans green beans, drained</li>
        <li>1 can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 can French-fried onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Mix green beans and condensed soup together in a large microwave-safe bowl until well combined. Microwave on high until warm, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese into the green bean mixture. Microwave on high for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture to a casserole dish and spread evenly over the bottom. Sprinkle French-fried onions over top, then sprinkle with remaining Cheddar.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and the onions are just turning brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
