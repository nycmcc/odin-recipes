    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups peeled, cubed sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanila extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped pecans</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Prepare sweet potatoes: Put sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Cook over medium-high heat until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Mash drained sweet potatoes with a fork. Add eggs; mix until well combined. Add sugar, milk, butter, vanilla, and salt; mix until smooth. Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Make topping: Mix brown sugar and flour together in a medium bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry cutter until mixture is coarse and looks like peas; don't overmix. Stir in pecans. Sprinkle topping over sweet potato mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
