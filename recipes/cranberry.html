    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This cranberry sauce recipe uses fresh cranberries, sugar, and orange juice to make a 
        Thanksgiving classic. Cranberry sauce is a fantastic make-ahead side dish. Since it needs 
        to chill to create the perfect consistency before serving, it might actually benefit you to 
        make it at least one day before you plan to serve it. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces cranberries</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup orange juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Dissolve sugar in the orange juice in a medium saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cranberries and cook until they start to pop, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and place in a bowl. It will thicken as it cools.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
